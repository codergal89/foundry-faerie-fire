She sought out one of the primal beasts: powerful, ancient beings that walk the wilds, effused with Living Light. Using ancient and profane rituals, the sorcerer was able to merge her spirit with that of the primal beast&rsquo;s, and together they became a new creature: the Blisterbeast.<br />This enchantment gave her untold powers and some mastery over the Living Light, enabling her to study it where others could not. But it also made a chimera from two fractured souls, dividing spiritual and mental energies.

Generally Adderweed has no qualms with the work; she enjoys a challenge, though she dislikes being called away from more important tasks.<br />Adderweed is aloof by choice and curious to a fault. She can never resist a question that needs answering, and of the fey court she is perhaps the most ravenous for clues as to what occurred prior to the schism.<br />Although she has no memory of her creator, Adderweed considers them her family and attempts to carry on their legacy. She spends her time tinkering in her workshop, where she creates marionettes to flit around the Wilds doing her bidding.
