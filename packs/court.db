How a mortal ruler could become a fey scientist remains a mystery not even Myriati can answer.</p>\r\n<p>The life she left behind was different enough to be almost unrecognizable, and some of the court question the truth of her discovery&mdash;though most fey would be at a loss to explain why Myriati would invent such a story, or even want to admit to ever being mortal at all.</p>\r\n<p>Myriati is ruthlessly inquisitive and passionately confrontational. Her vast learning and superior intellect sometimes come across as callous and smug, and she never hesitates to make her views (and disapproval) known. She is disdainful of all those she finds foolish (Antigone Wynne especially) and is often too impatient to make for a good conversationalist.

He became a master of divination, capable of uncannily accurate and detailed fortunes, and earned himself the title of Court Astrologer.<br />Despite this success, he can&rsquo;t help but worry that his fate still haunts him; however flamboyantly he might dress and loudly he might live, Antigone is often the first fey overlooked at court.<br />Antigone doesn&rsquo;t shy away from unsavory company, as he finds infamy as appealing as fame.

Nevertheless, Doctor Myriati enjoys privilege and power as a formidable fey noble&mdash;despite being at almost constant odds with her fellow courtiers.</p>\r\n<p>Like most of the court, Myriati has no memory of her life before the schism&mdash;but extensive research has led her to believe that millenia ago, she was born in the Material Plane: a monarch in her own right, seated at the head of a once-great empire. How a mortal ruler could become a fey scientist remains a mystery not even Myriati can answer.</p>\r\n<p>The life she left behind was different enough to be almost unrecognizable, and some of the court question the truth of her discovery&mdash;though most fey would be at a loss to explain why Myriati would invent such a story, or even want to admit to ever being mortal at all.</p>\r\n<p>Myriati is ruthlessly inquisitive and passionately confrontational. Her vast learning and superior intellect sometimes come across as callous and smug, and she never hesitates to make her views (and disapproval) known. She is disdainful of all those she finds foolish (Antigone Wynne especially) and is often too impatient to make for a good conversationalist. Despite this, she is arguably one of the more approachable members of the court, unlikely to discriminate simply on the basis of her station.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Lawful
