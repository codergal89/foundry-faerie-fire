How they inherited the throne is unknown.</p>\n<p>Though their rulings are often controversial, the Monarch&rsquo;s right to rule goes mostly unquestioned, except by the seditionist Volm and, curiously, by the Monarch themself. But they quickly get over this self- doubt when it strikes, for their mood is as changeable as a child&rsquo;s: at times playful, at others petulant, and always equal parts curious and stubborn.</p>\n<p>Despite this, the Monarch regularly demonstrates both great wisdom and terrifying power. Angering or challenging the Monarch&rsquo;s authority can easily become a fatal enterprise: a conjurer of tremendous strength, the Monarch is capable of willing anything they can imagine into being with a simple flick of their paintbrush.</p>","img":"modules/faerie-fire/images/the-fey-court/the-monarch.png"}
